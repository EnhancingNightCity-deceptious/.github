# Enhancing Night City - deceptious


We have the privilege of speaking with deceptious, a Cyberpunk mod author who pushes the boundaries of the types of mods that can be made. They are the author of the Romance Enhanced Series, New Quests and many other immersive improvements to Night City.

﻿Thanks for chatting to us. Would you mind telling us what got you into modding?

I have a background/job in game dev, and have used mods before for games like Fallout: New Vegas, Fallout 4, and Skyrim, but hadn’t actually made any mods myself until I was feeling really immersed in Cyberpunk 2077’s world that I felt it was worth seeing what I could make, and without being too late to the party!

What made you interested in making mods, and why did you choose to focus on what you have done?

It was during my second playthrough, meeting more of the characters, seeing more of the world, and enjoying the extra immersion that patch 1.3 had added that I realized, all of the parts are here; locations, characters, dialog, and animations. I bet I could mix these together and make a little mod where you can get a drink with someone in-game. That idea would eventually become Night City Interactions, but there was a lot to learn before that, and that’s when/how the Romanced Enhanced mods came to be.
